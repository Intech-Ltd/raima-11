2 - Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Area: TFS

 4618
        A database should only be managed by one tfs

        Workaround: Ensure that a tfs is not running in the subdirectory of another tfs.

 4626
        d_tfsIterateConnectedUsers callback function is not reentrant.


Area: Runtime

 2638
        On Unix, the directory is not synced. In rare circumstances,
        transaction log files may be lost after a crash.

        Workaround:
        If available, mount your filesystem with the option to always
        sync. Note that this will have an impact on performance, but
        will give better data safety in the event of a crash.

 3663
        The function d_initialize() must be used by itself in a
        transaction.

        Workaround:
        Explicitly iterate through all the records that are to be
        deleted and explicitly delete them.

 3664
        The function d_lmstat() can not determine which tfs to query

        Workaround:
        Ensure that the task passed into d_lmstat only has one tfserver 
        connected with it.


Area: SQL

 3424
        Right or left joins where without an index or references are not supported.

 3539
        A select with one left join and one inner join with the last join
        before the first one may be missing the null values in the result
        set.

 4452
        Equi-join support for native databases with unsigned data types with a non unique
        key are not supported.

 4597
        Executing a select statement when the database is not open returns "table not
        found" error instead of "database not open".

 4679
        The number of affected rows reported by "DELETE FROM table" may include cascade
        deleted rows, which is not clear from the tool output.


Area: ODBC

 4421
        When retrieving rows from a table with no indexed columns, Microsoft Access does
        not necessarily display the retrieved rows in the order of any of the included
        columns.

        Workaround: Click on the header of the column they wish to sort the result rows by
        and choose "Sort Smallest to Largest" or "Sort Largest to Smallest."


Area: Objective-C

 4732
        Using multidimensional uint8_t arrays to store binary data is not supported.


Area: Replication

 4246
        Replication to 3rd party database systems and RDM Server does not support
        recursive sets.

 4246
        Replication to 3rd party database systems and RDM Server does not support
        sets where record A owns B and B owns A through a different set.

 4514
        Replication and mirroring will not work properly unless "@[hostname/IP Address]"
        is specified after the master database name when calling dbget.

 4637
        Circular tables are currently not supported with replication.


Area: Utilties

 2929
        The utility dbimp and the dbimp_main() function is not reentrant.

 3060
        The utility dbrev and the dbrev_main() function is not reentrant.

 4683
        On Linux, servers will not shut down unless all active connections are
        disconnected first.

        Workaround: Ensure that all connections are disconnected from the server after
        sending a ctrl-c to the process.

 4750
        The utility dbrev will not correctly set the docroot.


3 - Other Notes and Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- The '-daemon' option when starting RDM servers on Unix has been replaced with '-start'.
- The TFS type can now be selected at runtime. In addition, the multiple TFS libraries
  have been consolidated into a single library.
- Significant changes have been made to the SQL Virtual Tables API. Please read the
  chapter "Using Virtual Tables to Access Any Data" in the SQL User's Guide for details.
