        <h3>	Introduction 
&#160;</h3>
        <p>This PS (Platform-Specific) Guide focuses on the INTEGRITY 10.0.x
operating system using "Single Address Space POSIX" for RDM. This
section explains:

        <ul>
            <li value="1">Integrity</li>
            <li value="2">Creating an Integrity kernel
    </li>
            <li value="3">Building RDM for Integrity
    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>RDM for Integrity is set up as a host/target install with a cross compiling procedure. Supported host platforms are Linux or Windows.</p>
        <p>This release of <span class="MyVariablesProductShortName">RDM</span> is supported for Green Hills INTEGRITY 10.0.x on
x86.</p>
        <h3>INTEGRITY</h3>
        <p>INTEGRITY is a POSIX like operating system for the embedded space. An
applications can use a number of address spaces with protection
between them or they can be linked directly into the kernel. INTEGRITY
also supports downloading of address spaces. Each address space is a
fully linked (possibly with use of shared libraries between the
address spaces). Applications must be put together using an
integration tool before they can be downloaded to the target.</p>
        <p>With INTEGRITY you have the option to use a real target or a
simulator. The simulators are simulators that actually
simulates the instruction set of the architecture. It is not
an environment using you host instruction set with a BSP on top of
your host OS to emulate the INTEGRITY environment.</p>
        <p>With INTEGRITY there are different options on how to get your code
running on a board or a simulator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A kernel that is able to dynamically download and load
      applications. When you are done the application can be unloaded.</li>
            <li value="2">Compile your application together with the kernel using the
      kernel's address space.</li>
            <li value="3">Use a number of address spaces. E.g. One for the kernel, one for
      the virtual file system server, one for the TCPIP stack, and one
      for the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our project files use the first approach using "Single
Address Space POSIX".</p>
        <h3>Creating an INTEGRITY kernel</h3>
        <p>Configuring and compiling an INTEGRITY kernel for "Single Address
Space POSIX" is done from within the Multi Project Manager.  Make sure
to include ffs, socket, net, and rpc.</p>
        <h3>Building RDM for INTEGRITY</h3>
        <p>For a Pentium target open the project file in the Multi Project
 Manager:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">  target/integrity/pcx86/default.gpj</pre>
        <p class="Notes">You may need to change the location of the INTEGRITY target OS to
    match your installation.  Please edit the project file before
    opening it or set the build options inside the Multi Project
    Manager to reflect your installation.</p>
        <p class="Notes">There are some sub projects that are greyed out.  These are not
    included in the package you have.  They are either sub projects
    for internal tests and tools that are not distributed or sub
    projects that are not included in the particular package you have.</p>
        <p>Build the project from within the Multi Project Manager.</p>
        <p>Tools and examples will show up under target/integrity/pcx86/mod.  The
files with extension '.ael' are INTEGRITY applications you can load
and run on the target.  You will not be able to set program
arguments so most of the tools will not be applicable for INTEGRITY.</p>
