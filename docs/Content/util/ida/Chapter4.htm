        <p>The <code>Record</code> command, selected from the <code>Database Access Commands</code> submenu, accesses the <code>Record Manipulation Functions</code> submenu, from which you can select a set of additional commands and submenus for managing records. This submenu is shown in Figure 8-9, followed by a description of each of its commands and their submenus. </p><pre xml:space="preserve"><b>Record Manipulation Functions</b>

        <h3>4.1.1 Keyscan command </h3>
        <p>Selecting the <code>Keyscan</code> command accesses the <code>Scan and View Record Based on Key</code> submenu, from which you can choose how to locate a record based on a key. This submenu is shown in Figure 8-10, followed by a description of its commands. </p><pre xml:space="preserve"><b>Scan and View Record Based on Key</b>

        <p>Scans records based on a key field. A list of all key field names will be displayed, from which you should select the field to be scanned. You will then be prompted to enter the value of the key where the scan will begin. If you press "Enter" instead of a key value, the scanning will begin from the first key. </p>
        <p>The records located by the scan will be paged and displayed in a horizontal packed format. This is similar to the format that would result if the struct variable corresponding to the record were statically initialized in a C program. That is, it would be enclosed in braces, { }, with each sub-field grouping separated by commas.

        <p class="Heading">Keyfind </p>
        <p>Quickly finds and displays one record. When you select a key field from the displayed list and enter a value, this command displays either the record associated with the specified key value, or if the key is not found, the record associated with the next key. Compound key and struct fields must be enclosed by braces ({ }). Character strings do not need to be delimited by quotation marks except when included as part of a struct field. </p>
        <p class="Heading">First </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the record associated with the first key in the key file. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Last </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the record associated with the last key in the key file. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Next </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the record associated with the next key in the key file. If a Next command causes a "no more keys" message at the end of a file, a subsequent Next command will return the first key. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Previous </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the record associated with the previous key in the key file. If a Previous command causes a "no more keys" message at the end of a file, the next Previous command will return the last key. </p>
        <h3>4.1.2 Get command </h3><pre>Displays the record located at a specified database address. 
When prompted for the database address, enter it as: 

<code>enter database address: [<i>f</i>:<i>r</i>]</code></pre>
        <p>where<i> f</i> is the file number and <i>r</i> is the record number.   </p>
        <h3>4.1.3 Enter command </h3>
        <p>Enters new records into the database. From the displayed list, select the record type to be entered. The <code>Display/Edit Record</code> submenu is then invoked. "Using the Access Record Commands" shows the <code>Display/Edit Record</code> submenu and describes its functions in detail. </p>
        <h3>4.1.4 Modify command </h3>
        <p>Invokes the <code>Display/Edit Record</code> submenu, which provides a set of tools for modifying the current record, which may be selected in a variety of ways. For detailed information, about the <code>Display/Edit Record</code> submenu, see <a href="#8.3.2">Using the Display/Edit Record Submenu Commands</a>. </p>
        <h3>4.1.5 Delete command </h3>
        <p>Deletes the current record from the database. The record must have been previously disconnected from all sets of which it was an owner or a member. </p>
        <h3>4.1.6 Recscan command </h3>
        <p>Invokes the <code>Scan and View Record Based on Database Address</code> command submenu. The commands in this submenu use the <code>d_recfrst</code>, <code>d_recnext</code>, <code>d_reclast</code> and <code>d_recprev</code> functions to locate the records, instead of the key traversal functions. </p><pre xml:space="preserve"><b>Scan and View Record Based on Database Address</b>

        <p>The records located by the scan will be paged and displayed in the same horizontal packed format as the <code>Keyscan</code> command. For more information about the display of various <span class="MyVariablesProductShortName">RDM</span> data types, see <a href="#8.3.3">Editing a Data Field</a>. </p>
        <p class="Heading">First </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the first record of the selected type in the data file. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Last </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the last record of the selected type in the data file. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Next </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the next record in the data file. When it reaches the end of the file, it displays a "no more records" message. A subsequent <code>Next</code> command will begin with the first record. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Previous </p>
        <p>Finds and displays the previous record in the data file. When it reaches the top of the file, it displays a "no more records" message. A subsequent <code>Previous</code> command will begin with the last record. </p>
        <h2>4.2 Using the Access Set Commands </h2>
        <p>Selecting the <code>Set</code> command from the <code>Database Access Commands</code> submenu, accesses the <code>Set Manipulation Functions</code> submenu, which provides a set of tools for managing sets. This submenu is shown in Figure 8-13, followed by a description of its functions. </p><pre xml:space="preserve"><b>Set Manipulation Functions</b>

        <p>The records located by the scan will be paged and displayed in a horizontal packed format. This is similar to the format that would result if the struct variable corresponding to the record were statically initialized in a C program.

        <p class="Heading">First command </p>
        <p>Finds the first member connected to the current owner of the set selected from the displayed list of set names. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Next command </p>

        <p>Finds the last member connected to the current owner of the set selected from the displayed list of set names. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Previous command </p>
        <p>Finds the previous member of a set. The first time (or after a "no more records" message), Previous displays the last member of the set. A Last or Next command must have preceded the call to Previous. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Connect command </p>
        <p>Connects the current record to the current owner of the set selected from the displayed list of set names. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Disconnect command </p>
        <p>Disconnects the current record from the set selected from the displayed list of set names. </p>
        <p class="Heading">Total command </p>
